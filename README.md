* Ruby version 2.7.1

* Rails 6.1.0

Note that the tutorial is taught in rails 4, and some commands may be depricated in later versions. You would have to google, use stack overflow among other resources to resolve such issues. A notable depricated command is "redirect_to :back" which has changed to "redirect_back(fallback_location:"/")" OR "redirect_back(fallback_location: root_path)" OR "redirect_back(fallback_location:"/users/new")". You can always pass in the path you wish to direct to as well.
